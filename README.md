Hello World!
The journey of an architect who designs buildings with code begins . 
The goal is to explore the possibilities of  a merged world between existing built forms and computational thinking .
This will help in identifying and abstracting Africa habitation problems into real world solutions.
May God's purpose and will prevail and may I establish authority in my new found gift.
